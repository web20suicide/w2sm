Probably you have heard that Facebook completely blocked and banned our service from their servers since last Sunday (in case you haven't, please follow the story <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/49470" target="_blank">here</a>).<br><br>Yesterday we received a Cease and Desist letter (you can read the pdf <a href="./downloads/Web 2.0_Suicide_Machine.pdf" class="sublink" target="_blank">here</a>) from Facebook lawyers asking us for stopping our service and removing all Facebook profile pictures we collected for the memorial pages. They even gave us a deadline to respond upon and we are currently considering our further steps.  
<br><br>
<span style="text-decoration:italic;">Time left to answer the letter:</span>
<div id="curvyWrapper"><div id="defaultCountdown"></div></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
var austDay = new Date();
austDay = new Date(austDay.getFullYear() + 0, 1 - 1, 12);
$('#defaultCountdown').countdown({until: austDay}); 
</script>
