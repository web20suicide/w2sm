Probably you have heard that Facebook completely blocked and banned our service from their servers since last Sunday (in case you haven't, please follow up the whole story by Paul McNamara <a style="color:#FF3F84;" href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/49470" target="_blank">here</a>).<br><br>Yesterday we received a Cease and Desist letter (you can read the pdf <a href="./download/Web_2.0_Suicide_Machine.pdf" style="color:#FF3F84;" target="_blank">here</a>) from Facebook lawyers kindly asking us to stop our service and remove all Facebook profile pictures we collected for the memorial pages and anything else which could be associated with Facebook from our website. They gave us quite some time to respond upon their request. Therefore, we are currently considering our further steps and watching the countdown.  
<br><br>
<span style="text-decoration:italic;">Time left to answer Facebook:</span>
<div id="curvyWrapper"><div id="defaultCountdown"></div></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
var austDay = new Date();
austDay = new Date(austDay.getFullYear() + 0, 1 - 1, 12);
$('#defaultCountdown').countdown({until: austDay}); 
</script>
