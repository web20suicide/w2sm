<p class="question">Do you store any data on your webserver, like password of the user?</p>

<p class="question">Will the 2.0 suicide machine be available for other networks such as twitter and plaxo?</p>

<p class="question">How does it work technically?</p>
<p class="answer">The machine consists of a tweaked Linux server running apache2 with python module. Selenium RC Control is used to automatically launch and kill browser sessions. This all driven by a single python/cgi script with some additional self-written libraries.  <br />
									Each user can watch her suicide action in real-time via a VNC remote desktop session, displayed on our website via an flash applet rendered live into the client's webbrowser. 
									We are also running some customized bash scripts plus MySQL in the background for logging and debugging, jquery for the website and a modified version of the great FlashlightVNC application built in Flex. 
									Web2.0 Suicide Machine consists of roughly 1500 lines of self-written code. </p>
