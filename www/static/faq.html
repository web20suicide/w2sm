<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br />
<p class="question">I am absolutely sure that my Facebook login details are correct, but the machine answers always with "Wrong password, dude!"? The facebook screen shows a message like "You are signing in from an unfamiliar location. For your security, please verify your account."</p>
<p class="answer">Since our service is located in The Netherlands, the facebook server is clever enough to detect that our machine tries to login from a different country than yours. Thus, it asks a security question which consists of your birthday used in your profile. To circumvent this security-problem we have implemented a small work-around. Please insert your birthdate in the lastwords textarea in this format (DD/MM/YYYY/). For example, the text "<b>24/12/1980/my last words</b>" would try to login with a birthdate on 24th December 1980!<br><br> If your problem is still not solved and login fails, please write us an email to suicide [ATTT] moddr {DOT.} net </p>

<p class="question">Why don't you just delete the account?</p>
<p class="answer">Please read the following question and answer!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">Why do we think the web2.0 suicide machine is not unethical?</p>
<p class="answer">Everyone should have the right to disconnect. Seamless connectivity and rich social experience offered by web2.0 companies are the very antithesis of human freedom. Users are entraped in a high resolution panoptic prison without walls, accessible from anywhere in the world. We do have an healthy amount of paranoia to think that everyone should have the right to quit her 2.0-ified life by the help of automatized machines. Facebook and Co. are going to hold all your informations and pictures on their servers forever! We still hope that by removing your contact details and friend connections one-by-one, your data is being cached out from their backup servers. This can happen after days, weeks, months or even years. So merely deactivating the account is just not enough!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">If I kill my online friends, does it mean they're also dead in real life?</p>
<p class="answer">No!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">What do I need to commit suicide with the Web 2.0 Suicide Machine?</p>
<p class="answer">A standard webbrowser with Adobe flashplugin and javascript enabled. So, it runs on Windows, Linux and Mac with most of browsers available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">If I start killing my 2.0-self, can <b>I</b> stop the process?</p>
<p class="answer">No!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">If I start killing my 2.0-self, can <b>YOU</b> stop the process?</p>
<p class="answer">No!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">What shall I do after I've killed myself with the web2.0 suicide machine?</p>
<p class="answer">Try calling some friends, take a walk in a park or buy a bottle of wine and start enjoying your real life again. Some Social Suiciders reported that their lives has improved by an approximate average of 25%. Don't worry, if you feel empty right after you committed suicide. This is a normal reaction which will slowly fade away within the first 24-72 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">I killed my 2.0-self with the web2.0 suicide machine, but I <b>still</b> have friends in my network?</p>
<p class="answer">This can happen to Facebook accounts with more than 800 friend connections. We are very sorry for the inconvenience of being left with a "not fully executed" 2.0 suicide and are currently trying to improve our scripts on this particular issue!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">Will the 2.0 suicide machine be available for other networks such as flickr, orkut and plaxo?</p>
<p class="answer">We are currently working on improving our products!. Currently we are working on flickr and Hyves, but of course we are eagerly thinking of ways to get rid of our "Google Lifes".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">How does it work technically?</p>
<p class="answer">The machine consists of a tweaked Linux server running apache2 with python modules installed. Selenium RC Control is used to automatically launch and kill browser sessions. This all driven by a single python/cgi script with some additional self-written python libraries.  <br />
Each user can watch her suicide action in real-time via a VNC remote desktop session, displayed on our website via an flash applet rendered live into the client's webbrowser. 
We are also running some customized bash scripts plus MySQL in the background for logging and debugging, jquery/PHP for the website and a modified version of the great FlashlightVNC application built in Flex. 
									Web2.0 Suicide Machine consists of roughly 2500 lines of self-written code. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">How much does it cost to kill myself?</p>
<p class="answer">Usage of Web 2.0 Suicide machine is for free at the moment. If you want to donate money for hosting, don't hesitate to get in contact with us!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="question">Can I build my own suicide machine?</p>
<p class="answer">Theoretically yes! Practically no (or let's say, not yet)! You'd need a Linux WebServer (apache2) with perl and python modules (php should be installed as well). Further, you'll need VNC-server and Java packages by Sun to launch selenium-remote applets. If you feel like contributing and can convince us with decent programming skills, please get in contact with us via email. We don't make the source code publicly available, since Facebook, Twitter, Myspace and LinkedIn would figure out how the suicidemachine is working in detail! So, please do <b>not</b> contact us, if you work for one of these companies!</p>
