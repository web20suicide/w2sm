The GIT repository is hosted at http://www.github.com

Software repository is: 

Once a user completes the form on the website, all his/her information is 
temporarily stored in a mySQL database (/usr/lib/cgi-bin/web20_dump.cgi).
Get an overview of the database by typing following URL into your browser:
-> http://localhost/phpmyadmin


	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/web20_dump.cgi
	
	This script will launch two xterm windows, one for the python script 
	(web20suicide.cgi) and one for launching the selenium java server 
	(start_selenium.sh), which will eventually control the Firefox webbrowser.

	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/settings.py

	Here are setting connections for mySQL stored

	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/start_selenium.sh

	This will launch the selenium instance:
	java -jar /usr/lib/cgi-bin/selenium-server1_0_3.jar -port 4441 -interactive \
		-forcedBrowserMode "*firefox /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.3/firefox" -log \
		"/tmp/selenium${JOBID}.log"
		
	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/web20suicide.cgi

	Core script (or the belly of the web2.0 suicidebeast!)
	It iterates through the temporary database (friendbot) to see if there are
	new entries. Once it picks up a new entry, it parses the variables and auto-
	matically deletes the database 

	web.20suicide.cgi imports several additional python files which hold 
	specific suicide script functions for each desired platform. Names are 
	self-explanatory.

	/usr/lib/cgi-bin/suicide_facebook.py
	/usr/lib/cgi-bin/suicide_linkedin.py
	/usr/lib/cgi-bin/suicide_myspace.py
	/usr/lib/cgi-bin/suicide_twitter.py

	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/web20clean_database.cgi

	Execute this if you have faulty requests inside your mySQL database
	# python /usr/lib/cgi-bin/web20clean_database.cgi

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things and ideas for the stable release

	Make it more robust (scripts tend to hang if unexpected things happen, such
			as browser lag, 404 errors, facebook makes automatic logouts from time
			to time, etc etc etc...)
	Implemenet more delete functions (improve regular expressions)
	Implement callback functions
	Shrink the bootable ISO image
