GENERAL
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# not for the public and with (really) messy code, but hey it's open source...

This is a LiveCD ISO Image based on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS* with additional packages 
installed (the release has been created using remastersys 
(http://geekconnection/remastersys) (*will be supported untill April 2013)

All changes to this ISO are persistent (as long as you've booted up from a 
writeable medium)

All access is being granted by following login credentials:

USERNAME is killer
PASSWORD is killer

You can freely redistribute and modify this release by creating your own boot-
able ISO image. Just start following command from a terminal:

# sudo remastersys backup suicidebuntu.iso 

creates a bootable ISO image /home/remastersys/remastersys/suicidebuntu.iso

Please report all bugs/suggestions to killer@moddr.net or join the irc channel
#suicidemachine at irc.freenode.net

HOW DOES IT WORK?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installed software in order to get web2.0 suicidemachine to run:

	apache2	
	php5 module
	mysql module
	python
	java-common packages
	firefox

All web-related stuff is stored in /var/www/w2sm
All cgi-scripts in /usr/lib/cgi-bin

Please take a look at /usr/lib/cgi-bin/install.sh to get a better understanding
for the software which has been installed on this system
This install script was used on this release! (if you've booted this release, 
you DON'T need to execute this file AGAIN!!!)

FILES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that /usr/lib/cgi-bin and /var/www/w2sm are under version 
controlling using GITHUB. If you've done major contributions and/or improvements
or you detected a bug, please commit your changes and mind conflicting stuff. 
Don't screw things up! Everyone is able to push/pull! We trust YOU!

The GIT repository is hosted at http://www.github.com

Software repositories are for: 
/var/www/ 		https://github.com/web20suicide/w2sm
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/	https://github.com/web20suicide/cgi-bin

Once a user completes the form on the website, all his/her information is 
temporarily stored in a mySQL database (/usr/lib/cgi-bin/web20_dump.cgi).
Get an overview of the database by typing following URL into your browser:
-> http://localhost/phpmyadmin

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/google.py
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Basic example showing how Selenium RC works. Before exectuing this file
	run following command in a terminal: 
	
	# java -jar /usr/lib/cgi-bin/selenium-server-standalone-2.19.0.jar -port 4441 
	-interactive -log "/tmp/selenium${JOBID}.log"
	
	open another terminal and run: 
	# python /usr/lib/cgi-bin/google.py

	Selenium RC will launch Firefox, open www.google.com and automatically
	trigger a query looking for the word "RANDOM"
	
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/web20_dump.cgi
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	This script will launch two xterm windows, one for the python script 
	(web20suicide.cgi) and one for launching the selenium java server 
	(start_selenium.sh), which will eventually control the Firefox webbrowser.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/settings.py
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Here are setting connections for mySQL stored (we used mySQL for queuing
  user requests and as some sort of "threading" so the cgi request doesn't 
	time out server-side)

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/start_selenium.sh
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This will launch the selenium instance:
	# java -jar /usr/lib/cgi-bin/selenium-server-standalone-2.19.0.jar -port 4441 \
	-interactive -log "/tmp/selenium${JOBID}.log"
		
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/web20suicide.cgi
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Core script (or the belly of the web2.0 suicidebeast!)
	It iterates through the temporary database (friendbot) to see if there are
	new entries. Once it picks up a new entry, it parses the variables and auto-
	matically deletes the database 

	web.20suicide.cgi imports several additional python files which hold 
	specific suicide script functions for each desired platform. Names are 
	self-explanatory.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/suicide_facebook.py
	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/suicide_linkedin.py
	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/suicide_myspace.py
	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/suicide_twitter.py
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	If you feel like expanding functionality and add a new plattform, please
	create a new file suicide_NEWPLATTFORM.py etc...

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/web20clean_database.cgi
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Execute this if you have faulty requests inside your mySQL database
	# python /usr/lib/cgi-bin/web20clean_database.cgi


DID YOU KNOW?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did you know that if you translate 'COCKTAIL' into German 
you get 'SCHWANZSCHWANZ'?


WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things and ideas for the stable release

	* Make it more robust (scripts tend to hang if unexpected things happen, such
  as browser lag, 404 errors, facebook makes automatic logouts from time
  to time, etc etc etc...)
	* Implemenet more delete functions (improve regular expressions)
	* Implement callback functions (selenium 2 seems to be promising!)
	* Shrink the bootable ISO image
